# ACMDD_Tyk2_2022
files regarding the report for the 2022 ACMDD course at Leiden University

The report can be found in the the "Report code.ipynp" file  

You start by getting information about the Tyk2 protein and a co-crystalized ligand followed by visualization of the protein and ligand.
You will then use a ChEMBL dataset containing compounds with known bioactivity for the Tyk2 receptor to train and select a model capable of predicting pChEMBL values for the Tyk2 receptor.
Compounds from PubChem with similarity to a known Tyk2 inhibitor will be selected followed by pChEMBL value predictions for said compounds using the trained model.
A few compounds with high predicted pChembl values will be docked and compared to known Tyk2 ligands and a few other JAK family inhibitors.
